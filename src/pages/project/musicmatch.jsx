            <h2 className={style.Header}>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              As a huge fan of Spotify’s music platform, I got tired of waiting
              an entire year for Spotify Wrapped to be released for me to see my
              listening statistics. So, last year, I taught myself React and
              built a web-player that provided users with improved insights of
              their listening history and provided recommendations based on
              their current “moods”.

                  Although I’m glad that I pursued the project and saw the
                  completion of all key features, there were plenty of issues
                  that made it far from complete. So, I found myself itching at
                  the opportunity to crack open the code-base and look at how my
                  skills had developed in only a year.

            <p className={style.Text}>
              After exploring the full capability of the Web API, I realized
              that I had barely begun to explore the potential applications of

              pairing my application with an external database and/or a
              websocket to stream data between simultaneous users.

            <h2 className={style.Header}>KEY FINDINGS</h2>
            <p className={style.FirstText}>
              I found that the only official listening stats released to users
              was Spotify Wrapped. It shows users their top five artists and
              tracks from that year, but it was only released in December.
            </p>
            <p className={style.FirstText}>
              As for music recommendations, Spotify had several options,
              however, none were very customizable. Users were given a weekly
              discover playlist with new tracks based on their short term
              listening history, daily mixes with familiar tracks based on their
              created playlists and saved libraries, and it suggested tracks to
              add to a playlist based on the five most popular artists in that
              playlist. All of these taken into account, the playlist
              recommendation was the most practical, however its implentation
              would often lead to skewed recommendations in very diverse
              playlists.
            </p>
            <p className={style.FirstText}>
              Although Spotify has detailed data about individual tracks such as
              “danceability” or tempo, the platform does not seem to use them
              for recommendation.
            </p>
            <p className={style.FirstText}>
              Given search functionality and detailed track insights from the
              API, I knew that MusicMatch could give users the option to do
              advanced searches for the types of tracks they wanted to hear. I
              could generate entire playlists given those search variables, and
              learn from the user’s music taste to provide better insights with
              each suggestion.
            </p>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              This data could then be used to create a unique score for the
              user, not to rank their taste but rather to classify it
              numerically. I could then take this score and use it to compare
              different users and determine their “compatibility”.

            <h2 className={style.Header}>USER RESEARCH TESTING</h2>
            <p className={style.FirstText}>
              After releasing a working prototype, I conducted user research
              testing to gain insights on the friction points of 3 task flows:
            </p>
            <h3>1. Enable “clean music” mode for playback</h3>
            <h3>2. Check your top artists/tracks</h3>
            <h3 className={style.Text}>
              3. Browse and play an unpopular track from an obsure artist
            </h3>

            <h2 className={style.Header}>USER TESTING INSIGHTS</h2>
            <h3>1. Why do I still need to launch Spotify to use this?</h3>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              One limitation of the API is its inability to begin playback on a
              specific device. Users were confused because they had to launch
              the app and begin playing music before the in-app player would
              appear, defeating the purpose of having only one application to
              use for Spotify. This is of course because my application cannot
              control a user’s device. I can, however, integrate the Spotify Web
              Playback SDK and link it with my application to play in-browser
              music, which is a future goal for the application.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Confusing navigation</h3>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              I got feedback about two different navigation issues, the first
              being what was on the stat page. When I told users to check their
              top tracks and artists, they immediately assumed that it would be
              on a profile page. When their only navigation link was “stats”, it
              was worded too technical for the average user and they did not
              associate it with personal insights. As soon as the other new
              features are implemented, I will move them along with the
              playlists link to the profile page.
            </p>
            <h3>3. What is “clean mode”?</h3>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              A feature I wanted to add to the application was a “clean mode”,
              which gave users the ability to skip explicit tracks in their
              playback. I thought it would be useful for professional gatherings
              or events where explicit music would not be appropriate, and it
              could easily be a feature toggled by a user through their expanded
              player. When I asked users to test the task flow of toggling it,
              every user asked where the settings were. Although my intention
              was to make this action easy to access and non-invasive through
              its placement in the expanded player, along with shuffle or
              repeat, users seemed to associate this feature with a settings
              menu. Also, users were confused by the wording of “clean mode”, so
              it has been changed with “skip explicit” for clarification while I
              test out a settings menu.

                  Artist page now reduces the space of popular tracks through
                  the use of a horizontal scroll, allowing more space for
                  tracks, albums, and similar artists. The detail panel at the
                  top also lists the artist’s popularity and associated genres,
                  which will be used to improve the suggestion algorithm. As
                  users look for more obscure artists in their preferred genres,
                  the popularity indication serves as a marker.

            <h3>1. It’s important to look back at your mistakes</h3>
            <p className={style.FirstText}>
              Refactoring old code is a huge project by itself. Even though it
              was only made a year ago, I think it was very encouraging to look
              at how far I have come as a developer. I remember sitting in class
              last year, scouring Stack Overflow for answers and waiting for
              someone to comment on my Github issues for hours, only to be told
              I forgot to include a return statement in my API call.
            </p>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              Although I didn’t need to go back and fix this project, I realized
              that a product is never truly finished. I learned a lot more about
              Next’s framework in a week than I had working on a collaborative
              project in a month.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Never use someone else’s work if you can do it yourself</h3>
            <p className={style.FirstText}>
              I used to have a naive mentality that there was no reason to do
              something myself if someone else had already done it for me.
              Although it saved me time and frustration, I was always restricted
              by the third party libraries I was using rather than my own
              knowledge limitations.
            </p>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              When it comes to design, there is justification in seeking
              inspiration and sticking to what is famililar with users, but
              there is also gratification when you take risks and try something
              brand new. I took inspiration from the design of popular music
              players in the market, and created an interface that prioritized
              the features that users wanted to see first.
            </p>

            <h2 className={style.Header}>NEXT STEPS</h2>
            <h3>1. Gamifying the Experience</h3>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              As I continue progress on the matching algorithm, I want to target
              the competitive nature of having statistics associated with the
              user’s listening history. Users should have “top genre” badges on
              their profiles along with their favorite artists and tracks -
              which in combination can create a “leaderboard” of music taste on
              each user’s profile. The compatibility feature will lead in nicely
              with this sense of one user’s taste being “better” or “worse” than
              anothers, although of course this is all subjective to the user’s
              preference.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Prioritize accessibility</h3>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              Something I take very seriously is accessibility. As I complete
              development work, I will use tools such as the WAVE accessibility
              extension to check that all of my code complies with A11y
              standards, and that the color contrast ration is above an 8
              throughout the site to allow for friction-free ability to use the
              application. I am referring to Material Design UI guidelines for
              padding, line spacing, and button size for accessibility purposes
              as well.
            </p>

            <h3>3. PWA!</h3>
            <p className={style.Text}>
              If I integrate the Web Playback SDK into my application, it could
              completely replace the Spotify application as the user’s primary
              tool for listening to music with their Spotify subscriptions. By
              converting the site into a progressive web application, users
              could download the app like any other onto their home screens for
              a faster launch.
