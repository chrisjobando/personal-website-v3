          In previous semesters, GT Bits of Good relied on email for nonprofits
          to connect with them. While this worked, it was clearly not optimal
          for establishing fluid and clear communication.

        <h4>
          Our team was created to create an application portal for potential
          nonprofit partners to submit a request to work with the organization
          and easily see their application status at any point.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          I worked primarily as a frontend developer for the team, but i was
          also able to get valuable experience with the Next framework and
          making API calls to the database.
