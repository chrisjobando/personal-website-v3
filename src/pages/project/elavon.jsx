          <p className={style.FirstText}>
            I was very fortunate to join the Elavon Bridge team right at the
            start of a major refactor. I learned the ins and outs of the new
            code-base and had my first true opportunity to apply the
            fundamentals of Java from my first two years at Georgia Tech towards
            a real-world software solution.
          </p>
          <p className={style.FirstText}>
            I not only got to review and contribute to code that handled over
            $12.5 billion in sales in 2019, but I also worked on a scrum team
            and was able to present my research and work with the entire team
            during our daily standups and biweekly retrospectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to thank my hiring manager Matt Mills for his support
            throughout the recruitment process as well as for checking up on me
            every other week, our engineering lead David Witherspoon for making
            sure i always had meaningful work to do, and one of my teammates
            Alden Oâ€™Neil for always answering my many questions throughout my
            internship.
